# USBGuard GUI (USBGuardGUI) — developer entrypoint.
#
# Every target is documented inline; run `make help` for the full list.
# Logic lives in the modular fragments under make/ so that this file stays readable:
#
#   make/common.mk   — environment, help, housekeeping, TODO tracking
#   make/quality.mk  — lint, format, audit, security gates
#   make/docs.mk     — MkDocs site and ADR scaffolding
#   make/release.mk  — versioning, build, SBOM, checksums, signing
#   make/rust.mk  — language-specific implementation of the target contract
#   make/project.mk  — optional, committed, targets that exist only in this project
#   make/local.mk    — optional, git-ignored, machine-local overrides

# Falls back to the scaffolded literal, so profiles without a TOML manifest
